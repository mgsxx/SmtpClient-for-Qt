[SMTP Client for Qt C++](https://github.com/bluetiger9/SmtpClient-for-Qt)

The code is LGPL licensed so it must be a dll in the case your app source code is not GPL.
It was not ready for such use so I modified the sources accordingly. 

I also was tempted to change a few things here and there.
One of such changes is a separate `include` dir.
