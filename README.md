(SMTP Client for Qt C++)[https://github.com/bluetiger9/SmtpClient-for-Qt]

The code is LGPL so it must be a dll in the case your sorces is not GPL.
It was not ready for such use so I modified it accordingly. 

I also was tempted to change a few thing here and there.
One of such changes is a separate `include` dir.
